#Shop system
This is my project just to practise programming in react and .NET
Idea came from my job for 1.5 year - I have been working as shop assistant in 4F and I really don't like the system that we got there. :)

To test the current state of a project:
1. Copy repository
2. Start front-end live server (VS Code recommended)
3. Start back-end live server (Visual Studio recommended)

What is included in project: <br/>
1.Company menager:<br/>
  1.1. User <br/>
    1.1.1. Register <br/>
    1.1.2. Display users by shops <br/>
  1.2. Shop <br/>
2. Shop menager: <br/>
3. Cash register: <br/>

Project in hold due to another project - KropkaNet - System for stocktaking purposes
