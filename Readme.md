#Shop system
This is my project just to practise programming in react and .NET
Idea came from my job for 1.5 year - I have been working as shop assistant in 4F and I really don't like the system that we got there. :)

To test the current state of a project:
1. Copy repository
2. Start front-end live server (VS Code recommended)
3. Start back-end live server (Visual Studio recommended)

What is included in project:
1.Company menager:
  1.1. User
    1.1.1. Register
    1.1.2. Display users by shops
