This is my project just to practise programming in react and .NET
Idea came from my job for 1.5 year - I have been working as shop assistant in 4F

To test the current state of a project:
1. Copy repository
2. Start front-end live server (VS Code recommended)
3. Start back-end live server (Visual Studio recommended)

More will come here ...
